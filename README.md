# Chore Monkey Frontend

The following repository contains the frontend implementation and all associated helper and utility business-based logic needed for that implementation. Chore Monkey is a task-based, shared agenda application that allows users to create households and organize other users into that household. Household owners are able to manage users, assign tasks, indicate task completion status and bring a little calmness to the entropy of day to day life and some order to whatever they define their 'household' to be.
